> Understand your substances, their effects, dosage and duration

Tripby is a website aimed to provide harm reduction information on psychoactive drugs. It started circa 2014 as a static website with about 20 substances curated from [Erowid](https://erowid.org) and translated to Portugese. At some point, we decided to stop maintaining those pages manually and did a major refactor to instead pull the data from the [PsychonautWiki](https://psy.is) public API.

The website is completely free and maintained by the community. Everyone is welcome to contribute through the wiki or our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tripby/tripby.org).

**Tripby is not a marketplace.**
